                    The combustion of fossil fuels emits a large amount of sulphur dioxide.
                    Carbon monoxide released  by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels results
                    in air pollution.

                    Air pollution, containing particulate matter and gases like

                    asthma and bronchitis. Many people die every year due to the direct
                    or indirect effects of air pollution.

                        Emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities trap heat in the atmosphere, 
                        causing global warming. This results in rising temperatures, melting ice caps, altered 
                        weather patterns, and more frequent extreme weather events.
